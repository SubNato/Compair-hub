# Compair-hub
Auto Media 

This is an app that allows Users to Compair (Compare. Using the name of the app lol) parts from different Dealers.
Still a learning curve as the framework that will be used is Flutter/ Dart (Which I do have experience in), with the 
RiverPod state management (Which I have never used before). So this will be interesting. 

This project will be launched as my first commercial or live project. God's willing, it will be great.

Project Base: In light of being unemployed for a while, this was the daily Bible verse on the day I created this repository on GitHub

Mark 12:10 : "And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected Is become the head of the corner: 
              This was the Lord's doing, And it is marvellous in our eyes?".

And remember this: Psalm 90:17 : "And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: And establish thou the work of our hands
                                  upon us; Yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.".
